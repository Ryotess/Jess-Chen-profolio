## Projects
### [Pic2Recipe: A Yolo based recipe recommender](https://github.com/Ryotess/Pic2Recipe--A_yolov8_based_recipe_recommender)  
[Cloud Run](https://pic2recipe-tm6hnb4x7q-uc.a.run.app/) | [Streamlit](https://pic2recipe-a-yolov8-base-recipe-recommender.streamlit.app/)  
mAP50: 0.9| mAP50-95: 0.68  
Using **Python** and **Ultralytics** to build a YOLO model capable of detecting food ingredients in a picture, and subsequently developing a recommender system to suggest users what kind of dishes they can cook. 
### [WSDM KKBox's Music Recommendation Challenge](https://github.com/Ryotess/KKBOX_Music_Recommendation_System)
Top 25% solution on Kaggle  
Using **Python**, **XGBoost**, **Sklearn** to build a music recommendation system.  
ML techniques such as: **User-item Matrix**, **PCA**, **Normalization**, ...etc. were used in this project.
### [Solar Panel Dust Detection](https://github.com/Ryotess/-Project-DeepLearning-CV-Solar_Panel_Dust_Detection)
Accuracy: 90%| F1-Score: 85%  
Using **Python**, **Selenium**, **Tensorflow(&Keras)**, and **EfficientNet**, I collect solar panel images through **web crawling** and perform data preprocessing tasks, including addressing **imbalanced data**, **resizing**, and **augmentation**. Subsequently, I employ various model architectures such as **CNN**, **SVM**, **ResNet50**, **VGG19**, and **EfficientNetB3** to create a model for the detection of dirt or contaminants on solar panels.
### [Stroke Prediction By Deep Learning](https://github.com/Ryotess/-Project-DeepLearning-Stroke_Prediction)
Accuracy: 82%| Recall: 58%  
Applying **DNN** by using **Keras** to predict whether a patient will get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
### Spotify Popularity Prediction
Using R to perform dimension reduction and machine learning methods like **PCA**, **FA**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**,... etc. to make a prediction of popularity of songs in Kaggle Spotify data.
